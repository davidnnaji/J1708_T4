# Overview
**J1708_T4** is a gateway utility library that is compatible with the [Teensy 4.x](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html). It provides basic tools for displaying, measuring, and sending traffic on an SAE J1708 bus. This code was written as part of my [Master's Thesis](#References) on securing legacy HD networks.

# Manual Installation
To install the library manually, you'll need to download it as a .zip file, extract it and put in the proper Arduino user library directory. The .zip file contains all you need, including a few examples on how to use it. If the library is installed properly, you should be able to see these examples in `File>Examples>J1708_T4`. 

You can also refer to articles within Arduino forums on custom library installation if you are unfamiliar with the process.

# Hardware
You'll need to incorporate a standard J1708 circuit with the Teensy 4.x to receive or transmit any messages to the serial bus. Here's a list of the minimum parts you'll need for one port. 

- (1x) Hex Inverter (NOT Gate)
- (1x) RS485 transceiver
- (2x) 4.7k ohm resistors
- (2x) 47 ohm resistors
- (Optional) LEDs

You can refer to the official standard or my own circuit implementation for inspiration.

# Design
The entire library revolves around a `J1708` object that is intended to represent a single port connection to the bus. This object is logically bound to a Teensy serial port on the of the users choice. All example use ports 3 and 4 by default to help avoid conflicts. 

One object is enough for interacting with the bus. Two objects can be linked together to create a simple network passthrough. The example script, `simplePass.ino`, should provide enough information to get acquainted with instantiating an object and linking multiple objects. The following component diagram provides the exact architecture of the example script.

# Serial API Usage
## Runtime Configuration
### Help
The `j1708config` command is useful for adjusting the display and the device port settings during runtime. You can bring up the help page with the following command to see the available options.

```
j1708config <port> -h
```

### Display Settings
For example, to adjust the display settings back to default use the following command.

```
j1708config <port> -s -d
```

### Network Statistics and Errors
Basic messaging statistics are tracked by any instatiated port automatically. To view them, enter the following command:

```
j1708config <port> -s -s
```

Typical network and messaging errors are also tracked. Below is table for reference.

## Sending J1708 Messages
`j1708send` is useful for sending traffic to the network using a specific port during run-time. Use the `-h` option for more information.

### Standard Message
To send a simple 4-byte message on port three, use the following command:

```
j1708send sp3 4 de.ed.be.ef
```

### Transport Protocol
SAE J1587 provides rules for transporting payloads greater than 19-bytes. Every `J1708` object has built-in processing and handling procedures for RTS, CTS, CDP, EOM, and Abort messages. This will only work when port processing is turned on. To send a large payload used the `-T` option of `j1708send`.

For example, to send a simple 30-byte message on port three, use the following command:

```
j1708send sp3 -T 30 de.ed.be.ef.de.ed.be.ef.de.ed.be.ef.de.ed.be.ef.de.ed.be.ef.de.ed.be.ef.de.ed.be.ef.de.ad
```

## Control via Python
If the Teensy is plugged-in via USB, you can use the `pyserial` library to send commands to your device instead of the Arduino serial monitor. Here's an example script to get started.

```
import serial
myTeensy = serial.Serial('COM7',115200)
myTeensy.write(b'j1708send sp3 4 de.ed.be.ef\r\n')
myTeensy.close()
```

# Limitations 
I'm a mechanical engineer doing programmer things. After writing this, I learned *how to* and *how to not* do stuff in C/C++. Bear in mind, even though my code has been unit tested, reviewed, and deployed on actual vehicle hardware, my code would certainly benefit from many more improvements.

> ⚠️ **TL;DR** Be warned - the performance of this library is limited.
